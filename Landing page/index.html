            <h2>Welcome to my painting page</h2>
            <p>"A picture can paint a thousand words." I found the one picture in my mind that does paint a thousand words and more.
                It was a couple of weeks ago when I saw this picture in the writing center;
                the writing center is part of State College. The beautiful colors caught my eye.
                I was so enchanted by the painting, I lost the group I was with. When I heard about the observation essay, 
                where we have to write about a person or thing in the city that catches your eye.
                I knew right away that I wanted to write about the painting.
                I don’t know why, but I felt that the painting was describing the way I felt at that moment.
